% This function calculates the average size of SSB and DSB lesions. 
% I: 'dataFolder' is a string with the path of the folder dontaining the
% data files.

% O: 'SSBLesionSizes' and DSBLesionSizes' are M x 1 arrays with the average
%       lesion size of each of the M simulations found in 'dataFolder'
%    'simNames' is a M x 1 cell with the names of each simulation
%% Example of Use
